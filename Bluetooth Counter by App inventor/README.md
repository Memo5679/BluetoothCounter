# Social-Spacing-with-MIT-App-Inventor
This app was built to check social divergence during a pandemic, such as the viral epidemic in 2020, to be used in an exhibition hall or a wedding hall on tablets around the place to ensure that within the Bluetooth range there are no more than 7 people; Otherwise, a sound, vibration, and sentence will be sounded within the number of devices.

-----------------------------------------------

A previous mission I did and helped me with this project: Algorithm for Social Distancing
https://github.com/Memo5679/Algorithm-for-Social-Distancing-/blob/master/Algorithm%20for%20Social%20Distancing%20.pdf

The design interface and what was used, I used the button to start the scan and stop to pause and switch to change between the number allowed during the Bluetooth range 3 or 10, and a list of devices that were found shows the Mac Study and after that.
An external Bluetooth add-on and its file attachment were used, an alarm sound and the audio file attachment used, and an hour for delaying

The block was used as a program code to run it, three functions were used, and the properties of the parts that I used were like Bluetooth and the buttons, sound, vibration, and menu connectivity were used to display the devices and delay time, there was no need to add a loop to the scan because it remains running as long as you did not turn it off

*In block:
- Label1 mean = status.
- Label2 mean = Level of social spacing.
- Label5 mean = count number.
- Label6 mean = the number of users chosen 3 or 7.

An aia file attachment for the Android operating system,
In addition to adding Bluetooth, which can be added from the design interface, which is in the form (edu.mit.appinventor.ble.aix)
